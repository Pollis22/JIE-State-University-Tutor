            At State University AI Tutor AI Tutor ("State University AI Tutor", "we", "us"), trust is not a feature – it's the product.
            Parents, students, schools, and businesses are handing us something incredibly valuable: their
            time, their learning, and their data. This page explains how we protect that trust across privacy,
            security, student safety, AI guardrails, and compliance.

            <p className="text-lg font-semibold mb-3">State University AI Tutor is built to teach, not to cheat.</p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
              <li>We use a Socratic tutoring approach – the tutor guides students with questions and step-by-step reasoning instead of just giving answers.</li>
              <li>We log and store sessions so parents, educators, and administrators can see that the student is actually learning, not copying.</li>
            </ul>
            <p className="mt-4">This philosophy shapes our product and our compliance posture.</p>

            <p className="mb-4">We collect only what we need to deliver safe, effective tutoring.</p>
            
            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-3">Types of data we handle (depending on how you use the platform):</h3>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mb-6">

              <li><strong>Learning data</strong> – uploaded assignments, lesson choices, questions, transcripts of tutoring sessions, progress information.</li>
              <li><strong>Usage data</strong> – app activity, device/browser info, general analytics.</li>
              <li><strong>Voice data</strong> – audio sent to our speech and AI providers when you use voice features.</li>

            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
              <li><strong>No selling personal data.</strong> We do not sell student or learner data.</li>
              <li><strong>No ads built on student data.</strong> We do not use student data to build targeted advertising profiles.</li>
              <li><strong>Limited use of data.</strong> Data is used only to:

            <p className="mb-4">We treat every account like it belongs to someone we know personally.</p>
            
            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-3">Core security practices include:</h3>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
              <li><strong>Encryption in transit & at rest</strong> – all connections use HTTPS/TLS; stored data is protected using industry-standard encryption.</li>
              <li><strong>Role-based access control (RBAC)</strong> – separate roles for students, parents, teachers, school admins, and business admins, so people only see what they're supposed to see.</li>
              <li><strong>Tenant isolation</strong> – school and business customers are logically separated to prevent cross-organization data access.</li>
              <li><strong>Backups & recovery</strong> – regular database backups and documented recovery procedures.</li>
              <li><strong>Least-privilege internal access</strong> – only a small number of authorized team members can access production systems, and only when required.</li>
              <li><strong>Monitoring & logging</strong> – security-relevant events and administrative actions are logged for auditing and incident response.</li>
            </ul>
